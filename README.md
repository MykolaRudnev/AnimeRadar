Tools that were used in the application:
  Firebase is a powerful cloud service that includes many useful functions that make it easier for a programmer in many different areas such as android, iOS, WWW. It allows the developer to personally create applications from the very beginning to the very end, while without this service one would have to have a small team of programmers who would perform certain tasks.
Firebase Auth - gives you the opportunity to register via Facebook, Twitter, Gmail or other social networking sites, which gives you the opportunity not to spend much time on the backend and focus on the program itself.
Â Firebase Storage is responsible for storing photos and materials. To use the data storage function, it is necessary to register in the program.
  Firebase database - a convenient NoSQL for storing data and simple unregistered queries. Thanks to this complex and complicated processes will not be able to filter out a large amount of data.
Firebase test Lab - testing Android applications on a large number of Google devices.
  Picasso - a powerful image download and caching library for Android. It does not use a large amount of RAM, thus showing good memory management results. This library is very easy to use, even from the very beginning it works effectively with memory.
  Firebase Test Lab - automatic testing of applications on the basis of downloading applications for a service that installs the application on the device for testing.
